## Hetero Neural Network Pipeline Example Usage Guide.

#### Example Tasks

This section introduces the Pipeline scripts for different types of tasks.

1. Binary Train Task:

    script: pipeline-hetero-nn-train-binary.py

2. Multi-label Train Task:

    script: pipeline-hetero-nn-train-multi.py

3. Train Task With Early Stopping Strategy:

    script: pipeline-hetero-nn-train-with-early-stopping.py

Users can run a pipeline job directly:

    python ${pipeline_script}
